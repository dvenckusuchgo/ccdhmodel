Entity - Any resource that has its own identifier * Patient * Project * ResearchSubject - A research subject is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject\u2019s privacy. * Specimen - Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation. Identifier Quantity - A structured object to represent an amount of something (e.g., weight, mass, length, duration of time) - including a value and unit. Mixins Slots \u279ecoding - A reference to a code defined by a terminology system \u279etext - A human language representation of the concept represented by the Coding \u279ecode - The value of the code itself. \u279edisplay - A human-readable name for the code. \u279esystem - The code system where the code is defined. \u279eversion - The version of the code system. id * Patient\u279eid - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.

This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system. * Specimen\u279eid - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system. \u279esystem - The system or namespace that defines the identifier. \u279etype - A code that defines the type of the identifier. \u279evalue - The value of the identifier, as defined by the system. \u279eidentifier - A 'business' identifier for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or authority, that persists across implementing systems. \u279etaxon - The taxonomic group (e.g. species) of the patient. \u279ecomparator - How to understand the value . . . < | <= | >= | > \u279eunit - Unit representation (e.g. mg, mL) \u279evalue - Numerical value (with implicit precision) \u279eassociated_patient - A reference to the Patient that is this ResearchSubject \u279eassociated_project - A reference to the Project(s) of which this ResearchSubject is a member \u279eidentifier - A 'business' identifier for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or authority, that persists across implementing systems (i.e. a 'logical' identifier).
