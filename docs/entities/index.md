### Classes

 * [CodeableConcept](classes/CodeableConcept.md)
 * [Coding](classes/Coding.md) - A structured representation of a coded/enumerated data value, that includes additional metadata about the code and code system.
 * [Entity](classes/Entity.md) - Any resource that has its own identifier
     * [Patient](classes/Patient.md)
     * [Project](classes/Project.md)
     * [ResearchSubject](classes/ResearchSubject.md) - A research subject is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject’s privacy.
     * [Specimen](classes/Specimen.md) - Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation.
 * [Identifier](classes/Identifier.md)
 * [Quantity](classes/Quantity.md) - A structured object to represent an amount of something (e.g., weight, mass, length, duration of time) - including a value and unit.
